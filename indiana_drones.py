 === Introduction ===

   The assignment is broken up into two parts.

   Part A:
        Create a SLAM implementation to process a series of landmark measurements (location of tree centers) and movement updates.
        The movements are defined for you so there are no decisions for you to make, you simply process the movements
        given to you.
        Hint: A planner with an unknown number of motions works well with an online version of SLAM.

    Part B:
        Here you will create the action planner for the drone.  The returned actions will be executed with the goal being to navigate to 
        and extract the treasure from the environment marked by * while avoiding obstacles (trees). 
        Actions:
            'move distance steering'
            'extract treasure_type x_coordinate y_coordinate' 
        Example Actions:
            'move 1 1.570963'
            'extract * 1.5 -0.2'

    Note: All of your estimates should be given relative to your drone's starting location.
    
    Details:
    - Start position
      - The drone will land at an unknown location on the map, however, you can represent this starting location
        as (0,0), so all future drone location estimates will be relative to this starting location.
    - Measurements
      - Measurements will come from trees located throughout the terrain.
        * The format is {'landmark id':{'distance':0.0, 'bearing':0.0, 'type':'D', 'radius':0.5}, ...}
      - Only trees that are within the horizon distance will return measurements. Therefore new trees may appear as you move through the environment.
    - Movements
      - Action: 'move 1.0 1.570963'
        * The drone will turn counterclockwise 90 degrees [1.57 radians] first and then move 1.0 meter forward.
      - Movements are stochastic due to, well, it being a robot.
      - If max distance or steering is exceeded, the drone will not move.
      - Action: 'extract * 1.5 -0.2'
        * The drone will attempt to extract the specified treasure (*) from the current location of the drone (1.5, -0.2).
      - The drone must be within 0.25 distance to successfully extract a treasure.

    The drone will always execute a measurement first, followed by an action.
    The drone will have a time limit of 10 seconds to find and extract all of the needed treasures.
